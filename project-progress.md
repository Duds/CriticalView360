   - Enhance the project's styling and visual appeal by leveraging the pre-built components and styles offered by Berry Dashboard.

## Next Steps:

1. Implement Logged-In User Features:
   - Update the Dashboard component to display a personalized welcome message using the user's name from MongoDB.
   - Implement user-specific functionalities, such as displaying user-specific data or providing access to user-specific settings.

2. Refine Backlog and Reprioritize Tasks:
   - Review the current backlog and make necessary adjustments.
   - Prioritize the implementation of bow ties and related functionalities.
   - Ensure the tasks align with the project requirements and user needs.

3. Implement Berry Dashboard:
